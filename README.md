# **Automated Car Parking System**

## **Overview**
Efficient parking management is a growing concern in urban areas due to increasing vehicle numbers, limited parking spaces, and inefficient manual parking systems. This project aims to develop a cost-effective and automated car parking system using readily available components such as Arduino and ultrasonic sensors. The system provides real-time parking slot availability updates to optimize space utilization, reduce search time, and enhance overall parking efficiency.

## **Problem Statement**
In urban areas, inefficient parking space management leads to congestion, fuel wastage, and driver frustration. Traditional parking systems require manual effort to locate available spaces, resulting in increased search time, traffic congestion, and environmental impact. Additionally, the lack of real-time information on parking slot availability compromises convenience and safety.

This project aims to address these challenges by developing a **cost-effective and automated car parking system** using readily available components such as Arduino and ultrasonic sensors. The system will provide real-time updates on parking slot availability, optimizing space utilization, reducing search time, and enhancing overall parking efficiency.

## **Objectives**
- **Reduce Search Time & Effort:** Provide real-time parking availability information to drivers.
- **Optimize Space Utilization:** Improve the efficiency of parking space management.
- **Enhance Safety & Convenience:** Minimize the need for drivers to manually search for vacant slots.
- **Use Cost-Effective Components:** Utilize easily accessible hardware like Arduino and ultrasonic sensors for seamless implementation.

## **System Components**
- **Arduino Board** – Controls the parking system logic.
- **Ultrasonic Sensors** – Detects the presence of vehicles in parking slots.
- **LCD Display / LED Indicators** – Displays real-time parking slot availability.
- **Wi-Fi Module (Optional)** – Enables remote monitoring and updates.
- **Power Supply Unit** – Powers the system components.
